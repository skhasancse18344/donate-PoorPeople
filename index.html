        <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are More In Need</h1>
        <p>As you think about the poor, the helpless, what is your compassion that can best help you with? It takes only a few minutes to know the requirements in slums, the AIDs orphans, the refugee camps. It is true that an individual alone cannot solve the needs of the world. But we can do something together.</p>

If you are not eligible, you can ask your parents for paying it to the right person. If they don’t give Zakat, politely and respectfully emphasize to them. Use wisdom & the right preaching.</p>
